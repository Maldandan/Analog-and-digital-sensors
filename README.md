# Analog Vs Digital Sensors

To better understand the many differences between analog and digital sensors, it’s essential to compare the types of settings and environments these sensors work best in. While analog sensors are known for their accuracy, the enhanced efficiency of digital sensors has pushed many companies and facilities to transition over to digital measurements. Along with the signal speed limitations that analog sensors have, these devices are becoming less common in the market because of their noise issues.

Despite the various limitations associated with analog sensors, they are still the primary sensor of choice for certain applications. The reason that analog sensors are still preferred in some scenarios is because of the fidelity and strength of their signals. For instance, analog recorders are preferred over digital recorders when it comes to audio recording. While digital recorders are able to produce somewhat strong audio, the quality and depth of the audio doesn’t match what you would hear with analog recorders.

When taking digital sensors into account, the signal a digital sensor produces is preferred for smartphones, digital electronics, and computers. Digital sensors are able to process data in megabits or gigabits. This data allows for the measurement of digital electronic devices and their capabilities. The reason that digital signals and sensors have been widely adopted is because of their noise immunity and quick data rates.

Sensors are able to measure a specific physical quantity before responding to this quantity. This response comes in the form of an output, which could be a voltage. **Analog sensors create analog signals from the quantity that is sensed. In comparison, digital sensors produce digital signals when performing a measurement**.

The most common types of analog sensors include sound sensors, light sensors, temperature sensors, and pressure sensors. Keep in mind that there can also be digital versions of temperature and pressure sensors. When you’re searching for the right sensor, you should first identify what type of application you require the sensor for. 

Cost may also be another major deciding factor to pick the type of sensor you will be using. If you need high quantity of sensors, you may consider going for Analog sensors since they are usually cheaper in price! How ever, if you won't be needing that amount of sensors, then you may go to go for the digital sensors or make the decision depending on the task or requirement of the sensor you will be using.

Here, I have used passive infrared(PIR) sensor and a photoresistor (light sensor) as an example of a digital and analog sensors respectively.
